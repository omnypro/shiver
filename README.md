Shiver
======

> Be in the know when your favorite streamers go live on Twitch, right in your menu bar.

Shiver was created to scratch an itch. Twitch has some features that might be cool to some when it comes to being notified of when streams go live, like email. But that's tough, because I hate email notifications. Likewise, their iOS application has a good (albeit janky at times) push notification experience, but when I want to watch a stream, I don't want to necessarily watch it on my iPhone.

Enter Shiver[^1].
